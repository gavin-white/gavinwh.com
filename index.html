                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I study <strong>computer science</strong> with a concentration in <strong>software</strong> at Northeastern University.
                        Some highlights of my coursework so far include Object Oriented Design, Web Development, Algorithms and Data, Computer Systems, and
                        Programming Languages. I take particular interest in effective software design and enjoy finding ways to write more 
                        intuitive and efficient programs. I have six months of experience as a <strong>software engineer co-op</strong> at Wayfair and
                        I'm actively pursuing another software engineering position.

                    <h3>My Experience</h3>
                    <p> 
                        I recently completed a software engineer co-op position at Wayfair.
                        There, as a member of a professional software team, I contributed to business-critical distributed systems, developing new features based on business need,
                         as well as identifying, investigating, and solving a variety of problems. I had the opportunity
                         to collaborate with other engineers on a regular basis, allowing me to gain insight into the architecture, technologies, and business processes
                          integral to the systems developed by our team. At Wayfair, I gathered exposure to many technologies including
                          GraphQL and REST APIs, SQL databases, Docker, Kubernetes, and much more.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Interests</h3>
                    <p>I am truly passionate about computer science. I enjoy jumping around from topic to topic, learning as much
                        as I can and broadening my knowledge of the field. I also take interest in the area of Computer Science education where I get to share this knowledge with others. 
                         I have previously been a Teaching Assistant for courses including Fundamentals of 
                        Computer Science and Object-Oriented Design, and I'm currently a <strong>Teaching Assistant
                        for Computer Systems</strong>, as well as a trained <strong>Peer Tutor</strong>. I individually
                        support students taking a variety of Computer Science courses, helping them master their coursework, set effective goals,
                        and improve their study strategies. Outside of Computer Science, I love to explore the city of Boston and am currently on a journey to visit as much 
                        of it as I can by foot.
