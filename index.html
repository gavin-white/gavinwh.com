                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I study <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a concentration in <strong>Software</strong> at Northeastern University.
                        Some highlights of my coursework so far include Object Oriented Design, Algorithms and Data, Computer Systems, and
                        Programming Languages. I take particular interest in effective software design and enjoy finding ways to write more 
                        intuitive and efficient programs. I am excited to be starting a <strong>Software Engineering</strong> co-op position this July.

                    <h3>My Experience</h3>
                    <p>I have been a Teaching Assistant for various courses and I am currently a <strong>Teaching Assistant
                         for Object-Oriented Design</strong>. I help students learn how to properly documents, organize
                         and structure their programs to make them maximally maintainable and extensible. I also help teach students how to write complex object-oriented systems applying 
                         SOLID principles and making effective use of design patterns. I am also a trained <strong>Peer Tutor</strong>. I individually
                         support students taking a variety of Computer Science courses, helping them master their coursework, set effective goals,
                         and improve their study strategies.

                    <h3>My Interests</h3>
                    <p>I am truly passionate about Computer Science. I enjoy jumping around from topic to topic, learning as much
                        as I can and broadening my knowledge of the field. I'm currently reading <strong>Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</strong>
                        to strengthen my knowledge of the low level implementations of features whose inner workings have always been a mystery to me. I
                        also spend my time learning about software design patterns and refactoring techniques.
                        Outside of Computer Science, I love to explore the city of Boston and am currently on a journey to visit as much of it as I can 
                        by foot.
