## About
**See the website in action:** [gavinwh.com](https://gavinwh.com)

This is my personal website that I build from scratch. The website was initially purely static HTML and CSS and was deployed on GitHub Pages. I later refactored the site to be a React app in order to make it easier to manage and extend. I chose to use TypeScript with React to enable more complex interactions on the site. For better support of React web applications, I switched to Netlify as my host. The website was built to be responsive and can easily be viewed on devices of various sizes.

## What's Included

The website includes a home page where I introduce myself, my experience and my interests. This page also gives contact information, as it serves as a landing point for potential employers or associates.

The site includes a page to view my resume. This page displays a Google Drive preview window. This standardizes the viewing experience and allows for easy access to the resume PDF file. It also makes it easy for me to update the resume that gets displayed in real time by changing the file on Google Drive.

The site includes a projects page that will eventually be used to show details about my various programming projects, but currently directs visitors to my GitHub profile where they can view the full source-code of all of my projects.
