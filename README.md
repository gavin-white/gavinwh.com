**See the website in action:** [gavinwh.com](https://gavinwh.com)

This is my personal website that I built from scratch. As this was my first major website, I chose not to use any template or framework; this way, I was able to get more experience learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. The website is responsive and can easily be viewed on devices of various sizes.

## What's Included

The website includes a home page where I introduce myself, my experience and my interests. This page also gives contact information, as it serves as a landing point for potential employers or associates.

The site includes a page to view my resume. This page displays a Google Drive preview window. This standardizes the viewing experience and allows for easy access to the resume PDF file. It also makes it easy for me to update the resume that gets displayed in real time by changing the file on Google Drive.

The site includes a projects page that will eventually be used to show details about my various programming projects, but currently directs visitors to my GitHub profile where they can view the full source-code of all of my projects.
